# Description

This bot will play magic piano tiles automatically on your browser.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install these relevant dependencies. We'll be importing these to run the python file.

```bash
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard
pip install pywin32
pip install opencv-python
pip install Pillow
```

## How to use
```
1. Open python IDLE, then copy the code on bot.py and paste it there.

2. Open https://www.agame.com/game/magic-piano-tiles using a browser.

3. Keep the browser on and visible and run the IDLE file (you may need to save the file first)
Bot will automatically detect the START button and will click that.
USE "ESC" TO ESCAPE FROM THE LOOP

4. Have fun :)
